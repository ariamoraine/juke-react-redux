Tripplanner Solution - Minimal UI
=================================

This solution is to allow you to submit to the design challenge without finishing the workshop. Note that the solution doesn't include the Google Maps integration, but it is fine to mock that out with an any image of appropriate size (for example from: http://www.fillmurray.com/). The challenge is to design a layout that *could* be functional similar to the example [here](http://imgur.com/GmCDdO9.png). It doesn't need to be functional, we really just want to see your design skills!
